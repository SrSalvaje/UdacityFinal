# My Malmö: Udacity´s FEND Final Project

This is the  8th assessment project for Udacity's FEND Nanodegree. It was built from the ground up using create-react app and relying on the API´s of FourSquare and Google Maps

## TL;DR

To launch the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Goal
I was tasked with building a website to display points of interest in my city. The site was built from the ground up by me, some code snippets to deal with the Google API where taken from their docs but modified to serve my needs.

Any section of code that is not original is accompanied by a comment crediting the source.

## How to return

Once you have cloned or downloaded this repo, run `npm install` to install all dependencies, then start the development server with `npm start`.
Note that if you do that, yopu will be running a development version in which the service worker is not available, if you wish to test the final build then run `npm run build`.

Depending on your development environment you may or may not have the dependencies required for the static server, pay close attention your console as it will prompt you to run any extra commands needed.

Once you are done, launch the server with `serve -s build` and check your console for the port on which the site is being served.
